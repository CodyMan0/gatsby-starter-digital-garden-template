## 000 - Knowledge Management



## 100 - Personal Management



## 200 - Philosophy 🤔, Psychology 🧠; Spirituality 🙏 , Religion ㊪
Is there no limit to this section? I use [[Philosophy MOC (Kit)]] as the big note and then point to things like: [[Stoicism MOC]], [[Confucianism MOC]], [[Religion MOC]], [[Taoism MOC]], and whatever else comes up.
[[Psychology MOC (Kit)]] is similar but different enough to have its own space.

## 300 - Social Sciences 👥
*The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society.*
While this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. That said, the [[People MOC]] is special note, along with [[Prominent People 🌋]].

I suppose I'll leave the [[Commonplace Book 📖]] here for now.

See also: Politics | Society | Law | Relationships

## 400 - Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics 🗣
A fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [[Rhetoric MOC]]. And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [[Language MOC]], [[Words MOC]], and especially [[Figures MOC]]. Not too far behind is the [[Leadership MOC]].

## 500 - Natural Sciences
A sharp break from the previous section, the 500s explores the natural world and universe in glorious notes like [[Cosmology MOC]] and [[Math MOC]]. 

See also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals

## 600 - Applied Sciences
A natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take thet the fundamentals of nature and *apply* them. My undergrad was in [[Engineering MOC]], which relates to my interest in [[Building Homes MOC]]. Later on, I developed the [[Editing Manual MOC]].

See also: Agriculture | Technology | Medical | [[AI MOC]] | Programming | [[Collective Intelligence MOC]] | [[Genetics MOC]] | [[Systems MOC (Kit)]]

## 700 - Art & Recreation
Ah the leisures of life. Remember leisure? Few really do. This section could easily balloon. 
- Art MOC | [[Design MOC]] | Architecture | Painting | 
- Film & TV | [[Movies MOC]] 
- Sports | [[Football MOC]] 
- Music | [[Jazz MOC]] | [[Vocals MOC]] 
- [[Cooking MOC]] | Leisure 
- `#source/movie🎬` | `#source/tv🎬` | `#source/music🎵` 

## 800 - Literature
If folks barely remember leisure, they likely completely forgot about classical literature. A great shame, neomania...we blind ourselves to some of humanity's greatest hits. Use [[Literature MOC]] as a launchpad.

## 900 - History & Biography & Geography
I've noticed I'm naturally building up the [[Ancient Greece MOC]], but I haven't cared to build out the [[History MOC]] just yet. The [[Places MOC]] is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.
